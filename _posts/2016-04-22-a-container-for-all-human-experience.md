**A CONTAINER FOR ALL HUMAN EXPERIENCE**

We are all a product of nature, and guests in her home. We live in a modern world where we've drawn false boundaries between what is, and what is not, nature. And yet all systems mimic nature in some way. Systems-thinking is rooted in nature. In essence, nature is a complex and interdependent system, and wisdom gathered from this awareness can have a positive impact on human decision-making for the world. Whether we like it or not, and whether we know it or not, we are in relationship to nature.
