**COMMUNITY MIMICS THE HEART, THAT ESSENTIAL PLACE WHERE ALL BLOOD IS CYCLED THROUGH TO CREATE GREATER WELL-BEING FOR A HUMAN BODY**  

Communities work in the same way because everyone wants to exist within community in some capacity. They seek a securely attached place in the world. In this way, communities are essential to human well-being. A nourishing community shares values, holds the capacity to evolve as a complex whole, and creates local resilience through growing emotional intelligence, working through challenges, and handling differences.
