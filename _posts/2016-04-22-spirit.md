**LIFTS US OUT OF THE EARTHLY REALM TO THE LARGER UNIVERSE OF UNKNOWN SPACE WITH MOMENTS OF LIBERATION AND SELF-DISCOVERY**

Spirit is the most elusive of all, because it relates to the experience beyond our mind and bodily senses. Spirit points to the magic of things. It provides a space for experienes in life that the cognitive mind can't quite process. Spirit touches the most intimate part of ourselves. It exists in the web that connects us all.
